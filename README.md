# CSQ

CSQ is a language which is written in C & C++ and having the syntax very similar to Python. It uses a compiler which compiles the code into C++ and then uses the C++ compiler to compile the code into a binary file.

It is currently in development and is not ready for use. Migration of codebase from C/C++ to Python is in progress.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CsqLang/Csq4
cd Csq4
make install
```

:warning: **Note**: Since the codebase is being migrated from C/C++ to Python, the installation process may change in the future.

## Features

-   Easy to learn syntax
-   Fast speed
-   Dynamic typing
