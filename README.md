# CSQ

CSQ is a language which is written in C/C++(Backend) and Python(Frontend) and having the syntax very similar to Python. It uses a compiler which compiles the code into C++ and then uses the C++ compiler to compile the code into a binary file.

It is currently in development and is not ready for use. Migration of codebase from C/C++ to Python is in progress.
