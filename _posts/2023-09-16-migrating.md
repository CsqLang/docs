# Migration from C/C++ to Python

## Introduction

Most of the codebase of CSQ is being migrated to Python from C/C++.
This is because Python is easier to learn and use than C/C++.
Also, Python is more portable than C/C++.
The migration is being done in a way that the codebase can be easily ported back to C/C++ if needed.
All the C/C++ code is still available.
