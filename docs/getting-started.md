## Hello World

We'll start off with a simple Hello World program.
You should create a file named `hello.csq` and put the following code in it:
Location: CsqEx/hello.csq
```csq
print 'Hello, World!'
```

You can run the program using the following command by going into the Csq directory.

```bash
python3.10 csq.py CsqEx/hello.csq
```

The may have noticed that the syntax is very similar to Python, but without brackets.
Since in Csq print is a keyword not a function.

The output of the program will be:

```bash
Hello, World!
```
