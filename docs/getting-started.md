## Hello World

We'll start off with a simple Hello World program.
You should create a file named `hello.csq` and put the following code in it:

```csq
print 'Hello, World!'
```

You can run the program using the following command:

```bash
csq hello.csq
```

The may have noticed that the syntax is very similar to Python, but without brackets.

The output of the program will be:

```bash
Hello, World!
```
